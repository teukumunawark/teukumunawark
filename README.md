# 💫 About Me:

Hi there! I'm **Teuku Munawar Khalil**, also known as **Munawar** or **Khalil**. I'm a passionate backend developer.

My programming journey initially began with a focus on mobile development, utilizing Flutter and Android. However, as my
interest in full-stack development grew, I transitioned to the backend world and am currently immersed in Spring Boot
development.

Presently, I work full-time as a Spring Boot backend developer. I'm always enthusiastic about crafting robust and
scalable backend systems, continuously learning and expanding my skillset in this domain.
